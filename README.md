# IM4717 Web Application Design Case Study 3 & 4

3(i) Form Validation: Modify the “Jobs” page so that the input data for name, email, start date and experience are validated once the data is entered into each field.
– The name field contains alphabet characters and character spaces.
– The email field contains a user name part follows by “@” and a domain name part. The user name contains word characters including hyphen (“-”) and period (“.”). The domain name contains two to four address extensions. Each extension is string of word characters and separated from the others by a period (“.”). The last extension must have two to three characters.
– The start date cannot be from today and the past.
– The experience field cannot be empty (This can be done in HTML5)

3(ii) Menu Update: Modify the “Menu” page to include order quantity and options for single or double shots. The sub-total for each order should be displayed along the total amount below the sub-totals. The subtotals and total should be computed using JavaScript function.
- Add	radio	buttons	for	price	selection
- Add	column	of	text	boxes	for	quantity	inputs	
- Add	column	of	text	boxes	for	sub-total	prices
- Add	text	box	for	total	price

4(i) Price Update: Implement additional pages to perform database management functions such as product price update and generation of daily sales report. As shown below is an administrative page to select a particular blend of coffee for price update. On clicking a corresponding check box, the user can key in the new sales price for a cup of coffee. On successful update of the sales price into the database, the updated sale prices should be automatically retrieved and display onto the same page for user confirmation.

4(ii) Sales Report: Add in an administrative page to generate the daily sales reports. Daily sales reports showing the total dollar sales by products and sales quantities by product categories (single and double shots) should be generated on separate pages. It should also be possible to report the product category which achieved the highest dollar sales in the latter report.
